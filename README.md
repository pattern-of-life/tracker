# Pattern of Life Tracker

## Members: Victor Benavente, David Banks, Justin Lange, Derek Hewitt

## Project Name: Marco Polo aka StalkerPy(Probably want to change it from stalker at some point)

## MPV Goals: Basic functionality would be to store GPS data on a hardware device and be able to read it on a front end when plugged into your cell phone or computer.

- Stretch: Transmit realtime data to include location and time.
- Stretch 2: Be able to control transmission to turn off via front end command or by timer if no movement detected in x amount of time.  
- Stretch 3: Start applying different power source to prolong ability to transmit and life of device.
- Stretch 4: Start worrying about packaging, i.e. heat generated by device being active, interference with RF transmission, method of deployment
- Stretch 5: Let's be honest, we aren't getting this far.
